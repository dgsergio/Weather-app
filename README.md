- [x] Find a public API that you want to use, such as the open-meteo API,
- [x] Create a new React component that will be responsible for fetching and displaying the data.
- [x] Use a library like Axios or Fetch to make a request to the API and retrieve the data.
- [x] Once you receive the data, store it in the component's state.
      Display the data in the component's user interface. You can use HTML elements like tables, lists, or cards to format the data in a visually appealing way.
